# Simulated Coretime Environment 

The purpose of this directory is to consolidate all the necessary components for testing RegionX functionality in one place. This repository offers zombienet scripts, simplifying the process of spinning up the required chains for testing.

### Topology

The local environment consists of three chains:
- Rococo relay chain
- Coretime parachain
- Swanky parachain (NOTE: This can be replaced by any parachain that supports WASM contracts)
